title: “Carp: A Language for the 21st century”

abstract (should be around 200 words): “The last few years have been
exciting for programming languages enthusiasts. Rust freed us from the
chains of garbage collection. Functional languages such as Haskell, Idris,
and Agda have given us expressive type systems. Lisps come back into the
mainstream consciousness, and they are bringing macros. In my talk “Carp: A
Language for the 21st century” I want to introduce you to an exciting new
programming language that aims to unify multiple branches of this development.
Carp is a Lisp that combines macros, a modern type system, and an adaption of
the Rust borrow checker to get rid of garbage collection. We will talk a bit
about the ideas and concepts behind the language before diving into a playful
hands-on demo, with the aim of empowering the audience to start working with
Carp themselves. In a blatant disregard of conference best practices, there
will be live-coding! To get our feet back on the ground afterwards, we
will also take a brief and honest look at the state of the language and
ecosystem, and cover how you could get involved!”

speaker bio: Veit is a jack of all trades, but a master of none. He
frequently oscillates between compiler development, writing, creating
generative art, and trying to get work done at his day job.
